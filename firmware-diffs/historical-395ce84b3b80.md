## Appended difference
Offset 96532, length 788, SHA256 `cb42d46e77e39307f1e73f4ecec34cc037663fc71c049b7dc3231272823524cd`. Exact appended bytes are in the adjacent .diff.json as a difference-only hex field. No .bin, .elf, assembly or decompiled source is included.

## Verification
Forward reconstruction and reverse-to-stock were executed offline against local originals and produced exact SHA256 matches. This does not establish recovery, compatibility with another version, or permission to flash.
