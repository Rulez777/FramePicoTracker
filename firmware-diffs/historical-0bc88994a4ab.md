## Appended difference
Offset 96532, length 788, SHA256 `e74c3357edfc16a0998de28d25bc5f09eed85694adaa0732b2d02c3b5641a4b3`. Exact appended bytes are in the adjacent .diff.json as a difference-only hex field. No .bin, .elf, assembly or decompiled source is included.

## Verification
Forward reconstruction and reverse-to-stock were executed offline against local originals and produced exact SHA256 matches. This does not establish recovery, compatibility with another version, or permission to flash.
